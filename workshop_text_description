Needing to make a plot thesis, assignment or publication ready? Or just wanting to impress your peers with your mad ggplot skills? (Best way to get friends just saying)

In the workshop we aim to give you a taste of what data visualisations are possible in R. We will dazzle you with an introduction to graphics cfreation using ggplot before changing how you see data using some core geographical principles (CRAP - Contrast, Repitition, Alignment and Prixmitiy). Through Applying CRAP you’ll find out how we can visualise data better through creating and grouping plots to present results in a clear and effective way. We will then present a worked example, where we evolve a plot from basic visualisation, to a publication ready rain cloud plot. 


This course assumes you have some basic coding skills in R. We provide an overview of ggplot() and provide code for all worked examples.



This workshop will be presented by Charlotte Page and Fiona Robinson.

Charlotte is a coral reef biologist and PhD candidate at UNSW. When she isn’t thinking about coral she might be thinking about data, and how we can use programmes like R to do science in exciting, efficient and effective ways.

Fiona is a plant modelling ecologist and PhD candidate at UNSW. She gets pretty excited about weird and wonderful plants, animals and fungi and finding new colour palettes to apply to graphs, maps and drawings (bulbasaur's colours being a current favourite).
