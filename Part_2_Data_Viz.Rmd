Today we are going to focus on how we can move plots along from a quick exploration of data - to a plot that clearly presents your data and illustrates your findings. We will do this by working through an example where we will make a plot type called a raincloud plot.


Goals of Part 2: 


1. Evolve a plot from basic visualisation to a raincloud plot!



(Note: We will be manipulating the data using functions from tidyverse - including pipes (%>%). These are great for streamlining code. You can find an introduction to using them here https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html.)

(Note: they have developed a package called 'raincloud plot'- however this is not yet on CRAN, it also wraps ggplot functionality into one function, instead of geoms. This means you can't edit each layer separately.)


A raincloud plot is three plot types into one: 

1. __Box plot__

2. __Density plot__ (histogram)

3. __Scatter plot__

Developed to overcome issues associated with masking distributions of data when plotting columns with error-bars. Raincloud plots allow visualisation of the raw data, distribution of the data as density and key summary statistics all at the same time. 


### Worked example: Visualising distributions (and make them rain data with raincloud plots)

> Behind every mean there is a distribution, and that distribution has a story to tell.

A rain cloud plot is a hybrid plot that brings together three plot types. They were first presented in 2019 and have since received a lot of attention on social media :[](https://twitter.com/micahgallen/status/1112780615198429185?lang=en

A raincloud plot is three plot types in one: 


1. __Box plot__

2. __Density plot__ (histogram)

3. __Scatter plot__


Developed to overcome issues associated with masking distributions of data when plotting columns with error-bars. Rain cloud plots allow visualisation of the raw data, distribution of the data as density and key summary statistics all at the same time. 


__Data__ 


The data we will be visualising is publicly available from the LTER Data Portal https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/home.jsp and comprise the coordinates of LTER sites and plant observations from an experiment at Niwot Ridge LTER.


a. Loading the data 
```{r}
# Load data - site coordinates and plant records from the Long Term Ecological Research # Network 
# Niwot Ridge site

lter <- read.csv("lter.csv")

niwot_plant_exp <- read.csv("niwot_plant_exp.csv")
```

This dataset is from a fertilisation experiment at Niwot Ridge LTER site. There are multiple plots per fertiliser treatment, and species occurrence in each plot was monitored over several years. 

In this workshop we are going to produce a rain cloud plot that compare species richness among fertiliser treatments over time.

__Data__ 

b.  First of all we need to calculate species richness: 
```{r}
# Calculate species richness per plot per year

niwot_richness <- niwot_plant_exp %>% group_by(plot_num, year) %>%
  mutate(richness = length(unique(USDA_Scientific_Name))) %>% ungroup()

```


c. Now we can visualise how species richness varies across fertilisation treatments.
```{r}

head(niwot_richness)

distributions1 <- ggplot(niwot_richness, aes(x = fert, y = richness)) +
    geom_violin()

distributions1

```

d. A useful first look at the data distributions! Can we bring in some colour, and add our theme so that the plot is more clear.

```{r}
  
distributions2 <- ggplot(niwot_richness, aes(x = fert, y = richness)) +
    geom_violin(aes(fill = fert, colour = fert), alpha = 0.5) +   # alpha controls the opacity
    scale_fill_viridis_d() + # Colour blind friendly palette

    my_plot_theme() 

distributions2
```


e. How about some summary statistics so we can begin to investigate differences between groups?

```{r}
# Overlay violins with box plots 

distributions3 <- ggplot(niwot_richness, aes(x = fert, y = richness)) +
    geom_violin(aes(fill = fert, colour = fert), alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(colour = fert), width = 0.2) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() + # Colour blind friendly palette
    my_plot_theme() 

distributions3

```

Time to level up!


f. Better still, we can add the raw data points to this plot. Adding raw points to the plot we just created would lead to a very messy plot...


Instead we can apply a number of changes to this plot that allow for clear visualisation of the boxplot, distribution and raw data side by side. 
Smoothing functions for violin plots can sometimes hide the true values of given variables - we can use ggdist() to add half violin plot. 
Colour - hex codes. 
Raw data - use lines instead of points 
Add theme 


```{r}


distributions5 <- ggplot(niwot_richness, aes(x = fert, y = richness, fill = fert)) +
ggdist::stat_halfeye(
    adjust = .5, 
    width = .6, 
    .width = 0, 
    justification = -.2, 
    point_colour = NA,
    alpha = 0.8
  ) + 
  geom_boxplot(
    width = .15, 
    outlier.shape = NA,
    alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_point(aes(y = richness, color = fert),
    ## draw horizontal lines instead of points
    size = 1.3,
    alpha = .1,
    position = position_jitter(
      seed = 1, width = .1
    )) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1.2, NA), clip = "off") + 
      # \n adds a new line which creates some space between the axis and axis title
    labs(y = "Species richness\n", x = NULL) +
    # Removing legends
    #guides(fill = FALSE, color = FALSE) +
    # Setting the limits of the y axis
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +
    # Picking nicer colours
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("#5A4A6F", "#E47250",  "#EBB261", "#9D5A6C")) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("#5A4A6F", "#E47250",  "#EBB261", "#9D5A6C")) +
  my_plot_theme()

distributions5

# "#9D5A6C"

```

Finally, for a full rain cloud plot, we can flip the axis. 

```{r}

distributions5 + coord_flip()

```


```{r eval=F, echo=T}

# Create new columns based on a combo of conditions using case_when()
# A fictional example

alpine_magic <- niwot_richness %>% mutate(fairy_dust = case_when(fert == "PP" | fert == "NP" |
                                                                   fert == "NN" ~ "Fertiliser", fert == "CC" ~ "Control"))

distributions_magic <- 
    ggplot(data = alpine_magic, 
           aes(x = reorder(fairy_dust, desc(richness)), y = richness, fill = fairy_dust)) +
  ggdist::stat_halfeye(
    adjust = .5, 
    width = .6, 
    .width = 0, 
    justification = -.2, 
    point_colour = NA,
    alpha = 0.8
  ) + 
    geom_point(aes(y = richness, color = fairy_dust), 
               position = position_jitter(width = 0.15), size = 1, alpha = 0.1) +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.8) +
    labs(y = "\nSpecies richness", x = NULL) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("turquoise4", "magenta4")) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("turquoise4", "magenta4")) +
    coord_flip() +
    my_plot_theme()

distributions_magic

```

Finally - we can bring these two plots together using patchwork() before saving the plot as a pdf. 

```{r}

```
